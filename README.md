# Chrome 49 fixed position smoothscrolling issue

Select text with your mouse 1 and hold it down. Use your <b>Mouse Wheel</b> to scroll up and down. You should notice the page barely scrolling anywhere. Remove the class "fixed" from the header element and try again. Page scrolls normally. Disabling Smooth Scrolling from about://flags also fixes this.
